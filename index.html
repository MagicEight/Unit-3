<center><h2>Details</h2></center> 
<h4>Tasks-</h4><center> Like mentioned earlier, the taks you will be performing during your job will be as follows: producing beats, writing songs, and just making a song or piece cohesive all around. What you end up doing all really just depends on what kind of music you want to be producing, example being that of EDM and Rap or Hip hop, the beats and lyrics themselves can be drastically different from one another, so keep that in mind when deciding on what field to enter.</center> <h4>Computer Use-</h4><center> Music production revolves almost entirely around computers, using many different programs in order to mix and put together songs as well as just recording and adjusting an artists voice. Pretty much everything in the studio is a computer and will all be use in order to create and finalize various projects that you hear hopefully hear in the future. So upon entering the field, be sure to get a feel of how everything works in order to maintain a grasp of how the music revolves in a constantly evolving age.</center> <h4>Salary-</h4> <center> Now we get into the most important pieces of information to many, the salary. How  uch money will you be making? Well that really falls on the artist, if you work for a major label or arist chances are, you're gonna be making more money, you could also go the route of making a name for yourself and starting your own career where people will come to you instead of the other way around like. Examples of which include: Dj Kaled, Metro Boomin, Skrillex and so on. Anual earnings for producers could range anywhere from $20,000-$1,000,000 a year. The median anual salary for a producer in 2014 was $48,858, which to many, especially in California is pretty low. The job itself can be a hit or miss, many people will get stuck in limbo and cannot advance their career, others go big and become renowned names withing the industry, ultimately, the choice is yours to either pursue the course or not but you have to remember to enjoy it, cause if you don't, then what's the point.</center>
